    <h2>My Ambition is to become a Software Developer</h2>
    <img src="./assets/developer.jpg" alt="ambition" id="ambition">
    <p>I want to become a Software Developer because I have always been curious about new technologies. How the
        applications run, games are created. Now that I have started to learn about coding I find it interesting and
        very simple to do. I look forward to creating many applications and games.</p>
